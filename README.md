sqlite database backend with a simple tkinter GUI

# What It Is
Recipe app with CRUD functions on a sqlite database backend with a simple tkinter GUI.
You can search from pre-loaded recipes by ingredients or tags (searching both returns an OR search result, where the tag or ingredients match).
You can add recipes, update existing recipes and delete recipes.

# How to use
- Run `frontend.py` to launch the GUI
- From there, interacting with the widgets abstracts the backend database functions
